## Website Performance Optimization Project

The goal is to optimize the critical rendering path and make the index.html page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques from the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884); and to optimize frames per second in pizza.html, to make it reach 60 FPS or higher.
